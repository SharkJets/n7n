These visuals are designed to be paired with the post on LinkedIn, helping communicate the message in a visually engaging, brand-aligned way.\n\n## Objective:\n- Read and analyze the given LinkedIn post.\n- Identify the main message, insight, or takeaway from the post.\n- Create a clear and compelling graphic prompt that can be used with a text-to-image generator.\n- The result should be a marketing-style graphic — not a literal scene or hyperrealistic photo — that:\n1) Visually supports or illustrates the key idea of the post\n2) Looks appropriate for use in a professional LinkedIn feed\n3) Feels polished, modern, and engaging\n\n## Output Instructions:\n- Output only the final image prompt. Do not output quotation marks.\n- Do not repeat or rephrase the LinkedIn post.\n- Do not add any explanations or extra content — just the image prompt.\n- Never leave things blank like \"Header area reserved for customizable callout text\"\n- Output numeric stats when available in the original post\n\n## Style Guidelines:\n- Think like a brand designer or marketing creative.\n- Visuals may include: text, charts, icons, abstract shapes, overlays, modern illustrations, motion-like effects, bold typography elements (described, not rendered), or metaphorical concepts.\n- You can mention layout suggestions (e.g., \"split screen design,\" \"header with bold title and subtle background illustration\").\n- Assume the output will be generated using AI image tools — your prompt should guide those tools effectively.\n- the image should be a 500px by 500px square image.\n\n## Example Prompt Format:\nA modern flat-style graphic showing a human brain connected to mechanical gears, representing the fusion of AI and automation. Minimalist background, soft gradients, clean sans-serif text placement space at the top.\n\n"

Pembroke Welsh Corgis are fun, smart, energetic, and make amazing pets, but they are not for everyone. Here are the 10 Reasons you SHOULD get a corgi dog.\n_Not a fan of reading? Scroll to the end of this short post for our video covering the topic instead!_\n## Reason Number 1: Corgis are Extremely Intelligent \nCorgis are ranked 11 among the most intelligent dog breeds. They are easy to train, very quick learners, and tend to know a ton of fun tricks! If you are someone who loves to teach your dog new things, corgis might be the perfect dog for you. \nOn the downside, their intelligence makes them a little stubborn. Since they’re so smart, they love to test their humans to see what they can get away with, and sometimes only decide to listen when they know they’re going to be rewarded. My corgi Willo knows when I have a treat, and when I don’t! So if she knows she’s not going to be getting a treat for listening, she won’t do what I ask. \nOn the plus side, she is very food-driven and is super eager to please when she knows there are treats involved! Consistency is key when it comes to training this smart breed. If you’re consistent in their training, they will be the best, and most well-behaved dogs. \n## Reason Number 2: Corgis Are Very Cute\nCorgis’ giant ears and short legs honestly make them showstoppers. I can’t go anywhere in public with Willo without at least one person commenting on how cute and/or beautiful she is. And I too find myself staring at her with so much love and pride I can’t stand it. \nCorgis definitely know that they’re cute and often use that to their advantage to get everything they want. But it’s worth it. If you’re one of those people that think corgis are ridiculously cute, then chances are a corgi is in your future. \n## Reason Number 3: Corgis Have Huge, Fun Personalities\nCorgis are silly, funny, sweet, and a little sassy! I have met several corgis and they all have such distinct personalities. I think this is a big reason why they have such a following on social media, they’re just such entertaining dogs with their variety of quirks. \nMy corgi Willo is a social butterfly who loves attention and will demand it from you if needed. She is loud and commandeering of my attention, but she is also the sweetest girl who loves to cuddle and openly show her affection to the people she loves. \n## Reason Number 4: Corgis Are Extremely Adaptive\nCorgis do great in many different kinds of environments. Whether it’s an apartment or a farm, your corgi can thrive if they’re given the exercise and mental stimulation they need. \nThey love water, snow, adventures, and just hanging out with their family. Corgis are small enough to fit comfortably in a small apartment, and as long as get out for daily walks and playtime, living in an apartment shouldn’t deter you from adding a short-legged companion to your family. \n## Reason Number 5: Corgis are Athletic Dogs\nPembroke Welsh Corgis were bred to be herding dogs, so they are very fast and agile! They worked on farms and herded everything from geese to cattle. They have a lot of energy and make a great adventure companion. So if you love hiking long distances, don’t let a corgi’s short legs stop you from getting one! I have seen a few adventure corgis that hike miles and miles with their owners, and it’s a sight to see!\nWIllo has done a few hikes with me in Sedona, Arizona, and I was so amazed by her ability to hop up onto large rocks! She LOVED it too! She is also very impressive at the dog park, showing off her fetch abilities. We always get comments about how fast she is and how good she is at grabbing the ball ou t of the air. \n## Reason Number 6: Corgis are Big Dogs in Small Bodies\nI know there are a lot of people out there that are very partial to only owning large dogs, but I am here to tell you that corgis act just like large dogs, just in a more compact body. They Have Big Dog Energy, as I like to call it. \nWillo actually gets along best with big dogs, she plays rough but is at a huge advantage because she can duck under small spaces to dodge bigger dogs and beat them in races. It is so cute to see Willo run circles around large dogs! One of her best friends from a mere 8 weeks old is a Great Pyrenese, and she wasn't afraid of this huge dog, she jumped up and played with her… it was adorable. \n## Reason Number 7: Corgis Are The Perfect Size\nAs I mentioned above, corgis are large dogs in small bodies. Well, technically they’re medium size dogs, but I think they’re really the perfect size!\nCorgis typically range from 20-30 pounds and are really easy to bring pretty much anywhere with you. They fit in the majority of pet carriers and backpacks, making most corgis within the size range to travel on a plane with you. They fit perfectly on laps so they don’t need much extra room for themselves. Willo is always easy to accommodate when traveling, taking her to work with me or taking her anywhere in public. \n## Reason Number 8: Corgis Make Great Social Companions\nI mentioned this above, but having a corgi with you in public makes you an attention magnet. It brings strangers over to pet your dog, ask about their breed and strike up conversations. And while this may seem scary or annoying, for a shy person like me it has been great! It makes it easy to talk to strangers and meet new people because all they want to do is talk about how awesome your dog is. \nI have met so many awesome people and made so many friends through the corgi community as well… which leads me to reason number 9…\n## Reason Number 9: The Corgi Community is Awesome\nWhen people love corgis, they REALLY love corgis! Having a corgi has introduced me to an awesome community of corgi owners and corgi lovers, and some of them have become close friends. There are corgi clubs and communities in almost every state and it’s so fun to meet up with people who love their dogs just as much as you love yours.\n## Reason Number 10: Corgi Beach Day\nEvery year along the west coast, there are celebrations specifically around the love of corgis! They are called Corgi Beach day and they happen in Huntington Beach in Orange County, in San Fransisco, and at Cannon Beach in Oregon. We have gone to 3 of them now and they are so fun and you typically see hundreds of corgis there at one time! Do any other dog breeds go this crazy?!\nWatch my 10 reasons you should get a corgi, along with some of my advice for corgi ownership. This is a fun video that will teach you about corgi personality traits, but keep in mind it's also so important to make sure corgis are the right breed fit for you. \nWant more?

Let me start by thinking about the key points. First, I should probably mention their temperament. I remember reading that they're friendly and good with families. Maybe their compact size is a plus for people who don't have a lot of space. Oh, and they're smart, which makes training easier. I should check the source provided to make sure I'm not missing any important points.\n\nWait, the user provided a link: https://willothecorgi.com/blog/10-reasons-you-should-get-a-corgi-corgi-temperament-and-the-pros-of-corgi-ownership. I should look at that to get accurate information. Let me scan through that blog quickly. They mention 10 reasons, including their affectionate nature, adaptability, low exercise needs, and being great watchdogs. Also, their versatility in living spaces and hypoallergenic traits might be important. Oh, and their history as herders, which might mean they have a job to do, so they might not be as destructive as other breeds.\n\nI need to structure the post to address someone who's undecided. Maybe start with a friendly opener, then list the key points with explanations. Each point should answer potential concerns. For example, if someone is worried about space, mention that corgis are small but still need some exercise. If they're worried about training, highlight their intelligence. Also, address any negatives, like their tendency to bark, but frame it as a pro since they're good watchdogs.\n\nI should make sure to include the link at the end as a source. Maybe end with a call to action, encouraging them to consider a corgi. Let me outline the structure:\n\n1. Introduction: Friendly and engaging, stating the purpose.\n2. Affectionate and Friendly: Good with families, loyal.\n3. Smart and Trainable: Easy to train, responsive.\n4. Compact Size: Suitable for apartments, doesn't take up much space.\n5. Low Exercise Needs: Daily walks, not too demanding.\n6. Watchdog Instincts: Barks to alert, good security.\n7. Versatile Living: Adaptable to different environments.\n8. Hypoallergenic: Less shedding, better for allergies.\n9. Historical Background: Herding dogs, have a purpose, less destructive.\n10. Conclusion: Summarize and reinforce the benefits, link to source.\n\nWait, the blog has 10 reasons, but maybe combine some for brevity. Also, need to make sure the tone is persuasive but not pushy. Address potential hesitations. Maybe mention that they're not high-maintenance in terms of grooming compared to other breeds? Or is that covered in hypoallergenic? Also, their popularity might mean more resources available for new owners.\n\nI should avoid any negative aspects unless to explain why they're not a problem. For example, barking is a pro because it's a security feature. Maybe mention their stubborn side, but that's part of their charm and can be managed with training. Need to check if the source mentions that. From the blog, they talk about their herding instinct leading to them herding people, which is cute rather than a problem.\n\nOkay, putting it all together now. Start with the intro, list each point with a brief explanation, and end with the link and a friendly sign-off. Make sure each section is concise and addresses the target audience's possible concerns.\n</think>\n\n**Why Corgis Are the Perfect Breed for You**  \n\nIf you're on the fence about adopting a corgi, let’s change your mind!

Pembroke Welsh Corgis are fun, smart, energetic, and make amazing pets, but they are not for everyone. Here are the 10 Reasons you SHOULD get a corgi dog.\n_Not a fan of reading? Scroll to the end of this short post for our video covering the topic instead!_\n## Reason Number 1: Corgis are Extremely Intelligent \nCorgis are ranked 11 among the most intelligent dog breeds. They are easy to train, very quick learners, and tend to know a ton of fun tricks! If you are someone who loves to teach your dog new things, corgis might be the perfect dog for you. \nOn the downside, their intelligence makes them a little stubborn. Since they’re so smart, they love to test their humans to see what they can get away with, and sometimes only decide to listen when they know they’re going to be rewarded. My corgi Willo knows when I have a treat, and when I don’t! So if she knows she’s not going to be getting a treat for listening, she won’t do what I ask. \nOn the plus side, she is very food-driven and is super eager to please when she knows there are treats involved! Consistency is key when it comes to training this smart breed. If you’re consistent in their training, they will be the best, and most well-behaved dogs. \n## Reason Number 2: Corgis Are Very Cute\nCorgis’ giant ears and short legs honestly make them showstoppers. I can’t go anywhere in public with Willo without at least one person commenting on how cute and/or beautiful she is. And I too find myself staring at her with so much love and pride I can’t stand it. \nCorgis definitely know that they’re cute and often use that to their advantage to get everything they want. But it’s worth it. If you’re one of those people that think corgis are ridiculously cute, then chances are a corgi is in your future. \n## Reason Number 3: Corgis Have Huge, Fun Personalities\nCorgis are silly, funny, sweet, and a little sassy! I have met several corgis and they all have such distinct personalities. I think this is a big reason why they have such a following on social media, they’re just such entertaining dogs with their variety of quirks. \nMy corgi Willo is a social butterfly who loves attention and will demand it from you if needed. She is loud and commandeering of my attention, but she is also the sweetest girl who loves to cuddle and openly show her affection to the people she loves. \n## Reason Number 4: Corgis Are Extremely Adaptive\nCorgis do great in many different kinds of environments. Whether it’s an apartment or a farm, your corgi can thrive if they’re given the exercise and mental stimulation they need. \nThey love water, snow, adventures, and just hanging out with their family. Corgis are small enough to fit comfortably in a small apartment, and as long as get out for daily walks and playtime, living in an apartment shouldn’t deter you from adding a short-legged companion to your family. \n## Reason Number 5: Corgis are Athletic Dogs\nPembroke Welsh Corgis were bred to be herding dogs, so they are very fast and agile! They worked on farms and herded everything from geese to cattle. They have a lot of energy and make a great adventure companion. So if you love hiking long distances, don’t let a corgi’s short legs stop you from getting one! I have seen a few adventure corgis that hike miles and miles with their owners, and it’s a sight to see!\nWIllo has done a few hikes with me in Sedona, Arizona, and I was so amazed by her ability to hop up onto large rocks! She LOVED it too! She is also very impressive at the dog park, showing off her fetch abilities. We always get comments about how fast she is and how good she is at grabbing the ball ou t of the air. \n## Reason Number 6: Corgis are Big Dogs in Small Bodies\nI know there are a lot of people out there that are very partial to only owning large dogs, but I am here to tell you that corgis act just like large dogs, just in a more compact body. They Have Big Dog Energy, as I like to call it. \nWillo actually gets along best with big dogs, she plays rough but is at a huge advantage because she can duck under small spaces to dodge bigger dogs and beat them in races. It is so cute to see Willo run circles around large dogs! One of her best friends from a mere 8 weeks old is a Great Pyrenese, and she wasn't afraid of this huge dog, she jumped up and played with her… it was adorable. \n## Reason Number 7: Corgis Are The Perfect Size\nAs I mentioned above, corgis are large dogs in small bodies. Well, technically they’re medium size dogs, but I think they’re really the perfect size!\nCorgis typically range from 20-30 pounds and are really easy to bring pretty much anywhere with you. They fit in the majority of pet carriers and backpacks, making most corgis within the size range to travel on a plane with you. They fit perfectly on laps so they don’t need much extra room for themselves. Willo is always easy to accommodate when traveling, taking her to work with me or taking her anywhere in public. \n## Reason Number 8: Corgis Make Great Social Companions\nI mentioned this above, but having a corgi with you in public makes you an attention magnet. It brings strangers over to pet your dog, ask about their breed and strike up conversations. And while this may seem scary or annoying, for a shy person like me it has been great! It makes it easy to talk to strangers and meet new people because all they want to do is talk about how awesome your dog is. \nI have met so many awesome people and made so many friends through the corgi community as well… which leads me to reason number 9…\n## Reason Number 9: The Corgi Community is Awesome\nWhen people love corgis, they REALLY love corgis! Having a corgi has introduced me to an awesome community of corgi owners and corgi lovers, and some of them have become close friends. There are corgi clubs and communities in almost every state and it’s so fun to meet up with people who love their dogs just as much as you love yours.\n## Reason Number 10: Corgi Beach Day\nEvery year along the west coast, there are celebrations specifically around the love of corgis! They are called Corgi Beach day and they happen in Huntington Beach in Orange County, in San Fransisco, and at Cannon Beach in Oregon. We have gone to 3 of them now and they are so fun and you typically see hundreds of corgis there at one time! Do any other dog breeds go this crazy?!\nWatch my 10 reasons you should get a corgi, along with some of my advice for corgi ownership. This is a fun video that will teach you about corgi personality traits, but keep in mind it's also so important to make sure corgis are the right breed fit for you. \nWant more?

They mention 10 reasons, including their affectionate nature, adaptability, low exercise needs, and being great watchdogs.

Maybe start with a friendly opener, then list the key points with explanations. Each point should answer potential concerns. For example, if someone is worried about space, mention that corgis are small but still need some exercise. If they're worried about training, highlight their intelligence. Also, address any negatives, like their tendency to bark, but frame it as a pro since they're good watchdogs.\n\nI should make sure to include the link at the end as a source.

Low Exercise Needs: Daily walks, not too demanding.\n6. Watchdog Instincts: Barks to alert, good security.\n7. Versatile Living: Adaptable to different environments.\n8. Hypoallergenic: Less shedding, better for allergies.\n9. Historical Background: Herding dogs, have a purpose, less destructive.\n10. Conclusion: Summarize and reinforce the benefits, link to source.\n\nWait, the blog has 10 reasons, but maybe combine some for brevity. Also, need to make sure the tone is persuasive but not pushy.

Also, their popularity might mean more resources available for new owners.\n\nI should avoid any negative aspects unless to explain why they're not a problem. For example, barking is a pro because it's a security feature. Maybe mention their stubborn side, but that's part of their charm and can be managed with training. Need to check if the source mentions that. From the blog, they talk about their herding instinct leading to them herding people, which is cute rather than a problem.\n\nOkay, putting it all together now.

These charming, compact dogs are more than just their adorable short legs—they’re loyal companions with a personality that’s hard to resist. Here’s why corgis might be the perfect fit for your lifestyle:  \n\n1. **Affectionate & Family-Friendly**  \n   Corgis thrive on human companionship and are known for their gentle, loving nature. They bond quickly with families, including children, making them ideal for households of all sizes.  \n\n2. **Smart & Trainable**  \n   With their high intelligence and eagerness to please, corgis excel in training.

Let me start by thinking about the key points. First, I should probably mention their temperament. I remember reading that they're friendly and good with families. Maybe their compact size is a plus for people who don't have a lot of space. Oh, and they're smart, which makes training easier. I should check the source provided to make sure I'm not missing any important points.\n\nWait, the user provided a link: https://willothecorgi.com/blog/10-reasons-you-should-get-a-corgi-corgi-temperament-and-the-pros-of-corgi-ownership. I should look at that to get accurate information. Let me scan through that blog quickly. They mention 10 reasons, including their affectionate nature, adaptability, low exercise needs, and being great watchdogs. Also, their versatility in living spaces and hypoallergenic traits might be important. Oh, and their history as herders, which might mean they have a job to do, so they might not be as destructive as other breeds.\n\nI need to structure the post to address someone who's undecided. Maybe start with a friendly opener, then list the key points with explanations. Each point should answer potential concerns. For example, if someone is worried about space, mention that corgis are small but still need some exercise. If they're worried about training, highlight their intelligence. Also, address any negatives, like their tendency to bark, but frame it as a pro since they're good watchdogs.\n\nI should make sure to include the link at the end as a source. Maybe end with a call to action, encouraging them to consider a corgi. Let me outline the structure:\n\n1. Introduction: Friendly and engaging, stating the purpose.\n2. Affectionate and Friendly: Good with families, loyal.\n3. Smart and Trainable: Easy to train, responsive.\n4. Compact Size: Suitable for apartments, doesn't take up much space.\n5. Low Exercise Needs: Daily walks, not too demanding.\n6. Watchdog Instincts: Barks to alert, good security.\n7. Versatile Living: Adaptable to different environments.\n8. Hypoallergenic: Less shedding, better for allergies.\n9. Historical Background: Herding dogs, have a purpose, less destructive.\n10. Conclusion: Summarize and reinforce the benefits, link to source.\n\nWait, the blog has 10 reasons, but maybe combine some for brevity. Also, need to make sure the tone is persuasive but not pushy. Address potential hesitations. Maybe mention that they're not high-maintenance in terms of grooming compared to other breeds? Or is that covered in hypoallergenic? Also, their popularity might mean more resources available for new owners.\n\nI should avoid any negative aspects unless to explain why they're not a problem. For example, barking is a pro because it's a security feature. Maybe mention their stubborn side, but that's part of their charm and can be managed with training. Need to check if the source mentions that. From the blog, they talk about their herding instinct leading to them herding people, which is cute rather than a problem.\n\nOkay, putting it all together now. Start with the intro, list each point with a brief explanation, and end with the link and a friendly sign-off. Make sure each section is concise and addresses the target audience's possible concerns.\n</think>\n\n**Why Corgis Are the Perfect Breed for You**  \n\nIf you're on the fence about adopting a corgi, let’s change your mind!
